# **First-Python-Data-Analysis**

### Task

* Create 2 Python scripts that analyze data from a CSV file:
  * One for banking records (PyBank).
  * One for polling records (PyPoll).
* PyBank:
  * Analyze banking data from the "budget_data.csv" file to calculate the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset.
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  * The average of the changes in the "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
 
* Output of Results:

* PyPoll:
  * Analyze polling dating from the "election_data.csv" file to calculate the following:
  * The total number of votes cast.
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes.
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won.
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
 
* Output of Results:

* EXTRA CONTENT: PYBOSS 
  * Import the "employee_data.csv" file and perform the following conversions:
  * The "Name" column should be split into separate "First Name" and "Last Name" columns.
  * The "DOB" data should be re-written into "MM/DD/YYYY" format.
  * The "SSN" data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
  * The "State" data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
  
* See "PyBoss" folder under "ExtraContent" for code and results.
 
 ### Instructions
 
 1. Open the "main.py" file that you wish to run the script for (PyBank, PyPoll, or PyBoss)
 1. Make sure that the proper path to the data is set.
 1. Run the python script.
 
 ### Conclusion
 
 The results themselves are self-explanatory from the screnshots and are also entirely useless as this was a exercise using artifical data. Personally, what this analysis taught me is the importance of sound logic flow in code. The logic for the "PyBank" analysis gave me more trouble than expected due to initial logic flaws. Although simple and straighforward, I learned a lot from these basic analyses and I now know how useful planning and visualizing your code with a flow chart can be.
