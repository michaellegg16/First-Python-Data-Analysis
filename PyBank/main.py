# In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company
# You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv
# The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses

# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

# The total number of months included in the dataset
# The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

#First import the os module to allow us to create file paths across operating systems
import os

#Import the module for reading CSV files
import csv

#Create variables and empty lists

# Iterate through the rows of data in order to:
# Add up the total months
# Calculate the net total of profit/loses of the entire period
# Calculate the average monthly change over the entire period
# Calculate the max/min monthly change 

    for row in csvreader:

        #Add 1 to the total months variable for each row
        Total_Months += 1

        #Add the value of profit change as in integer to the total net profit variable
        currentProfit = int(row[1])
        Total_Net_Profit = Total_Net_Profit + currentProfit

        #Subract the previous profit from the current profit
        Monthly_Change = currentProfit - previousProfit

        # Store this value in the empty list
        Monthly_Change_List.append(Monthly_Change)

        #Replace the previous profit vairable with the current profit variable for the next iteration
        previousProfit = currentProfit

        #Add  the profit change up
        Profit_Change += Monthly_Change

        #Find the max/min profit change
        Greatest_Monthly_Profit = max(Monthly_Change_List)
        Greatest_Monthly_Loss = min(Monthly_Change_List)

        #Add the date of each row to a list
        Date_List.append(row[0])

        #Crate a variable for the date of the max profit/loss
        Date_Of_Max_Profit = Date_List[Monthly_Change_List.index(Greatest_Monthly_Profit)]
        Date_Of_Max_Loss = Date_List[Monthly_Change_List.index(Greatest_Monthly_Loss)]




# Print the data to terminal and calculate the average monthly change.
# NOTE: All values are the same as example data except for average monthly change.
# Might have something to do with negative values of the way I am calculating then summing monthly change.
